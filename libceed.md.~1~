MFEM is a free, lightweight, scalable C++ library for finite element methods.

Its goal is to enable high-performance scalable finite element discretization
research and application development on a wide variety of platforms, ranging
from laptops to exascale supercomputers.

Its features include:

* Arbitrary high-order finite element [meshes](http://mfem.org/features/#wide-range-of-mesh-types)
and [spaces](http://mfem.org/features/#higher-order-finite-element-spaces).
* [Wide variety](http://mfem.org/features/#flexible-discretization) of finite element discretization approaches.
* Conforming and nonconforming [adaptive mesh refinement](http://mfem.org/examples/?amr).
* Scalable to [hundreds of thousands](http://computation.llnl.gov/blast/parallel-performance) of cores.
* ... and [many more](http://mfem.org/features/).

MFEM is being developed in [CASC](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc),
[LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov) and is freely available under LGPL 2.1.

In CEED, MFEM is a main component of the efforts in the [Applications](ap.md) and [Finite Element](fe.md) thrusts.
