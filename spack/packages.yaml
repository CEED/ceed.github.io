# a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy organizations (Office

# testbed platforms, in support of the nation's exascale computing imperative.

# Spack likes to build all of its packages. The file `~/.spack/packages.yaml`
# allows you to list packages already install on your system for Spack to use
# instead of compiling them itself.
#
# This is an example of a packages.yaml for Mac OS X, El Capitan, v10.11.6
# clang@7.3.0-apple, arch=darwin-elcapitan-x86_64, hostname=parsol.llnl.gov
#
# The packages in ~/brew were installed with Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) using
# e.g. "brew install autoconf". The packages in /usr are provided by Apple and
# come pre-build with Mac OS X. The cuda package is provided by NVIDIA and
# should be installed separately by downloading it from
# http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html.
