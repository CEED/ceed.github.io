libCEED is a high-order API library, that provides a common algebraic low-level
operator description, allowing a wide variety of applications to take advantage
of the efficient operator evaluation algorithms in the different CEED packages
(from a single source).

One of the challenges with high-order methods is that a global sparse matrix is
no longer a good representation of a high-order linear operator, both with
respect to the FLOPs needed for its evaluation, as well as the memory transfer
needed for a matvec. Thus, high-order methods require a new "format" that still
represents a linear (or more generally non-linear) operator, but not through a
sparse matrix.

The goal of libCEED is to propose such a format, as well as supporting
implementations and data structures, that enable efficient operator evaluation
on a variety of computational device types (CPUs, GPUs, etc.). This new operator
description is based on algebraically factored form, which is easy to
incorporate in a wide variety of applications, without significant refactoring
of their own discretization infrastructure.
