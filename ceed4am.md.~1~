### Overview

CEED will hold its third annual meeting August 6-8, 2019 at Virginia Tech in
[Goodwin Hall 155][MAPGoodwin].  The goal of the meeting is to report on the
progress in the center, deepen existing and establish new connections with ECP
hardware vendors, ECP software technologies projects and other collaborators,
plan project activities and brainstorm/work as a group to make technical
progress. In addition to gathering together many of the CEED researchers, the
meeting will include representatives of the ECP management, hardware vendors,
software technology and other interested projects.

### Registration

If you plan to attend, [please **register** no later than **June
30**](https://forms.gle/1oH9W2aWp74H4BLAA).  The registration fee for the
meeting is $60, payable at the door in cash or check upon arrival at the
meeting.  Checks should be made payable to the Treasurer of Virginia Tech.  The
fee covers snacks and refreshments each day as well as a CEED T-shirt.

### Meeting Agenda

**UPDATE 08/07/2019**:  Due to potentially inclement weather, the hike to the

A distinguishing feature of this code is the modular CS infrastructure (Axom), and choice of high order numerical methods. The choice of high order schemes leads to higher arithmetic intensity per data access, a trait favored by modern computing processors. In this talk, we provide an overview of recent developments within the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian package, Blast, and focus on our adoption of programming models and algorithmic tailoring to leverage next gen super computers.

| 8:00-8:30   | **Coffee**                                                                          |
| 8:30-9:00   | **VTK-m Plans for Higher-Order Elements** <br> Hank Childs (Oregon)                 |
| 9:00-9:30   | **Devil Ray:  Ray Tracing High Order Meshes for Visualization** <br> Matt Larsen (LLNL) <br> *This talk will outline our efforts to develop a portable ray tracing library for high-order meshes. Our technology stack includes RAJA and Umpire, which allows Devil Ray to run on Nvidia and AMD GPUs as well as many-core CPUs. Initially, Devil Ray is focused on image-based visualization tasks such as iso-surface, volume rendering, and slicing, but our long term goals include extracting high-order iso-surfaces. When released, our library will be deployed inside of Ascent, a in situ visualization library.* |

| 10:30-11:00 | **Low-Synch Gram-Schmidt Projection Schemes for GMRES-AMG and for Moving Mesh Solvers** <br> Stephen Thomas (NREL) <br> *In collaboration with Tim Warburton and Anthony Austin, we apply the low-synch classical Gram-Schmidt algorithms recently proposed by Swirydowicz et al (2018) to the least-squares polynomial projection schemes introduced by Fischer (1998). We modify the original projection scheme to instead compute an improved initial guess for a preconditioned GMRES-AMG pressure solver for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. For the Nalu Wind model, the GMRES iteration count drops to zero with a relatively small window of previous solutions.* |
| 11:00-11:30 | **Fast Direct Solvers in MFEM** <br> Pieter Ghysels (LBNL) <br> *We present recent improvements in the SuperLU and STRUMPACK sparse direct solvers and preconditioners, which are available from MFEM. Support for GPUs has been improved or added. The preconditioners in STRUMPACK have been improved and tested on an indefinite Maxwell problem using MFEM.* |
| 11:30-12:00 | **Algebraic Multigrid Preconditioners for Matrix-Free Discretizations** <br> Bruno Turcksin (ORNL) <br> *Multigrid preconditioners are very popular preconditioners because of their convergence properties and scalability. Multigrid methods can be divided into geometric multigrid (GMG) and algebraic multigrid (AMG). GMG are based on building different coarser grids and therefore, are excellent as matrix-free preconditioners. The challenge is that GMG cannot be easily applied when the mesh is unstructured. AMG, however, use the entries in the matrix of the system to build coarser grids. This makes AMG more flexible when the matrix is available but it limits their use as matrix-free preconditioners. We surpass the limitation of knowing the matrix entries by basing our AMG on the spectral AMGe method. Unlike other AMG, the spectral AMGe method does not use the matrix of the system. Instead it requires the eigenvectors of the operator evaluated on parts of the domain (agglomerates). This means that, similar to GMG, a mesh is required. However the constraints on how the agglomerates are built are minimal since we do not need to rediscretize the operator on the agglomerates. While at the fine level no matrix associated to the operator is assembled, we still assemble a matrix at the coarsest level in order to use a direct solver.* |
| 12:00-12:30 | **Recent Progress on Accelerating Algebraic Multigrid Solvers with GPUs** <br> Ruipeng Li (LLNL) <br> *Modern many-core processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming an integral part of many high performance computing systems nowadays. These processors yield enormous raw processing power in the form of massive SIMD parallelism. Accelerating multigrid methods on GPUs has drawn a lot of research attention in recent years. For instance, in recent releases of the HYPRE package, the structured multigrid solvers (SMG, PFMG) have full GPU-support for both the setup and the solve phases, whereas the algebraic multigrid (AMG) solver, namely BoomerAMG, has only its solve phase been ported and the setup can still be computed on CPUs only. In this talk, we will provide an overview of the available GPU acceleration in HYPRE and present our current work on performing AMG setup on GPUs. In particular, we focus on the computation of distributed triple-matrix multiplications (i.e., the Galerkin product), which often represents a significant cost of the entire setup phase of AMG. We will discuss in detail the composing parts of this computation that include several fast GPU sparse matrix kernels and communications between GPUs. The recent results as well as future work will also be included.* |
| 12:30-2:00  | **Lunch**                                                                           |
| 2:00-3:00   | **AMD HIP Tutorial** <br> Noel Chalmers and Damon McDougall (AMD)                   |
| 3:00-6:00   | Hackathon                                                                           |
|             | *Dinner on your own.*                                                               |
