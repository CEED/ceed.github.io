![MAGMA Features and Support](../img/magma_features.png)
MAGMA (Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures) is a collection of
next generation linear algebra libraries for heterogeneous architectures. MAGMA
is designed and implemented by the team that developed LAPACK and ScaLAPACK,
incorporating the latest developments in hybrid synchronization- and
communication-avoiding algorithms, as well as dynamic runtime
systems. Interfaces for the current LAPACK and BLAS standards are supported to
allow computational scientists to seamlessly port any linear algebra reliant
software components to heterogeneous architectures. MAGMA allows applications to
fully exploit the power of current heterogeneous systems of multi/many-core CPUs
and multi-GPUs to deliver the fastest possible time to accurate solution within
given energy constraints.

### Hybrid Algorithms
![MAGMA Hybrid Algorithms as DAGs](../img/magma_dag.jpg)
MAGMA uses a hybridization methodology where algorithms of interest are split into tasks of
varying granularity and their execution scheduled over the available hardware components.
Scheduling can be static or dynamic. In either case, small non-parallelizable tasks, often on the
critical path, are scheduled on the CPU, and larger more parallelizable ones, often Level 3 BLAS
are scheduled on accelerators.

### MAGMA Development

MAGMA is being developed at the [Innovative Computing Laboratory](http://icl.cs.utk.edu)
of the [University of Tennessee](https://www.utk.edu/).

In CEED, MAGMA is mainly involved in the efforts of the 
and [Software](sw.md) thrusts.
