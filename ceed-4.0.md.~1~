# CEED 3.0 Software Distribution

The CEED distribution is a collection of software packages that can be
integrated together to enable efficient discretizations in a variety of
high-order applications on unstructured grids.

CEED is using the [Spack](https://spack.io) package manager for compatible
building and installation of its software components.

In this version, CEED 3.0, the CEED software suite consists of the
following 12 packages, plus the CEED *meta-package*:

- **GSLIB**-1.0.6
- **Laghos**-3.0
- **libCEED**-0.6
- **MAGMA**-2.5.3
- **MFEM**-4.1
- **Nek5000**-19.0
- **Nekbone**-17.0
- **NekCEM**-c8db04b
- **OCCA**-1.0.9
- **PETSc**-3.13
- **PUMI**-2.2.2
- **Remhos**-1.0

If you are interested in the previous releases, see the
[CEED-2.0](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed-2.0/) and
[CEED-1.0](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/ceed-1.0/) pages.

First-time users should read [Simple Installation](#simple-installation) and
[Using the Installation](#using-the-installation) below. (Quick summary: you can
build and install all of the above packages with: `spack install ceed`)

If you are familiar with Spack, consider using the following machine-specific
configurations for CEED (see also the [spack-configs](https://github.com/spack/spack-configs)
repository and the [xSDK's config files][xsdk-configs]).

via email at [ceed-users@llnl.gov](mailto:ceed-users@llnl.gov).
For issues related to the CEED Spack packages,
please start a discussion on the GitHub [@spack/ceed][ceed-spack] page.

## Simple Installation

If Spack is already available on your system and is visible in your `PATH`, you
can install the CEED software simply with:

```sh
spack install -v ceed
```

To enable package testing during the build process, use instead:

```sh
spack install -v --test=all ceed
```

If you don't have Spack, you can download it and install CEED with the following
commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
cd spack
./bin/spack install -v ceed
```

To avoid long compile times, we strongly recommend that you add a `packages.yaml` file
for your platform, see above and the [Tips and Troubleshooting](#tips-and-troubleshooting)
section.

## Using the Installation

Spack will install the CEED packages (and the libraries they depend on) in a
subtree of `./opt/spack/<architecture>/<compiler>/` that is specific to the
architecture and compiler used (multiple compiler and/or architecture builds can
coexist in a single Spack directory).

Below are several examples of how the Spack installation can be linked with and
used in user applications.

### Building MFEM-based Applications

The simplest way to use the Spack installation is through the
[`spack location`][spack-loc] command. For example, MFEM-based codes, such as
the MFEM examples, can be simply built as follows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mfem/mfem.git
cd mfem; git checkout v4.1
cd examples
make CONFIG_MK=`spack location -i mfem`/share/mfem/config.mk
cd ../miniapps/electromagnetics
make CONFIG_MK=`spack location -i mfem`/share/mfem/config.mk
```

Note that if you already have multiple Spack installations of MFEM, the above
`spack location` commands will fail and you will need to use a more concrete
spec such as `mfem~cuda` instead of simply `mfem`.

Alternatively, the Spack installation can be exported to a local directory:

```sh
mkdir ceed
spack view --verbose symlink ceed/mfem mfem
```

Once again, if you already have multiple Spack installations of MFEM, then you
will need to use a more concrete spec such as `mfem~cuda` instead of simply
`mfem`.

The `ceed/mfem` directory now contains the Spack-built MFEM with all of its
dependencies (technically, it contains links to all the build files inside the
`./opt/spack/` subdirectory for MFEM). In particular, the MFEM library in
`ceed/mfem/lib` and the MFEM build configuration file in
`ceed/mfem/share/mfem/config.mk`.

This directory can be used to build the MFEM examples as follows:

```sh
# Clone MFEM next to the "ceed" directory created above
git clone https://github.com/mfem/mfem.git
cd mfem; git checkout v4.1
cd examples
make CONFIG_MK=$PWD/../../ceed/mfem/share/mfem/config.mk
```

The MFEM electromagnetics miniapps can further be built with:

```sh
# Continuing from the last directory above: .../mfem/examples
cd ../miniapps/electromagnetics
make CONFIG_MK=../../../ceed/mfem/share/mfem/config.mk
```

### Building libCEED-based Applications

Below we illustrate how to use the Spack installation to build libCEED-based
applications, by building the examples in the current libCEED distribution.

Using [`spack location`][spack-loc], the libCEED examples can be built as
follows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CEED/libCEED.git
cd libCEED/examples/ceed
make CEED_DIR=`spack location -i libceed`
./ex1-volume -ceed /cpu/self
```

If you have multiple builds of `libceed` or `occa` you need to be more specific
in the above [`spack location`][spack-loc] command. To list all `libceed` and
`occa` versions use [`spack find`][spack-find]:

```sh
spack find -lv libceed occa
```

Then either use [variants][spack-specs] to choose a unique version, e.g.
`libceed~cuda`, or specify the hashes printed in front of the `libceed`
[spec][spack-specs], e.g. `libceed/yb3fvek` or just `/yb3fvek` (and similarly
for `occa`).

The serial, OpenMP, OpenCL and GPU OCCA backends can be used with:

```sh
./ex1-volume -ceed /cpu/occa
./ex1-volume -ceed /omp/occa
./ex1-volume -ceed /ocl/occa
./ex1-volume -ceed /gpu/occa
```

In order to use the OCCA GPU backend, one needs to install CEED with the `cuda`
[variant][spack-specs] enabled, i.e. using the [spec][spack-specs]
`ceed+cuda ^magma cuda_arch=70 ^mfem cuda_arch=sm_70`:

```sh
spack install -v ceed+cuda ^magma cuda_arch=70 ^mfem cuda_arch=sm_70
```

For more details, see the section [GPU demo](#gpu-demo) below.

With the MAGMA backend, the `/gpu/magma` resource descriptor can also be used.

The MFEM/libCEED and PETSc/libCEED examples can be further built with:
```sh
# Continue from the last dir above: .../libCEED/examples/ceed
cd ../mfem
make CEED_DIR=`spack location -i libceed` MFEM_DIR=`spack location -i mfem`
./bp1 -no-vis -o 2 -ceed /cpu/self -m `spack location -i mfem`/share/mfem/data/star.mesh
./bp3 -no-vis -o 2 -ceed /cpu/self -m `spack location -i mfem`/share/mfem/data/star.mesh
cd ../petsc
make CEED_DIR=`spack location -i libceed` PETSC_DIR=`spack location -i petsc`
./bps -degree 2 -ceed /cpu/self
```
Note that if `PETSC_ARCH` is set in your environment, you must either unset it
or also pass `PETSC_ARCH=` in the above command.

Depending on the available backends, additional CEED resource descriptors,
e.g. `petsc/bps -problem bp1 -degree 2 -ceed /ocl/occa` or `mfem/bp1 -no-vis --order 2 -ceed
/gpu/occa` can be provided.
See [libCEED Examples](https://libceed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) for
more on available examples/miniapps and how to run them.

Finally, the Nek5000/libCEED examples can be built as follows:
```sh
cd ../nek5000
export CEED_DIR=`spack location -i libceed` NEK5K_DIR=`spack location -i nek5000`
./make-nek-examples.sh
```
Then you can run the Nek5000 examples as follows:
```
export MPIEXEC=`spack location -i openmpi`/bin/mpiexec
./run-nek-example.sh -e bp1 -c /cpu/self -n 2 -b 3
```
In the above example, replace `openmpi` with whatever the MPI implementation
you have installed with spack. Also, you can do `./run-nek-example.sh -h`
to find out the options supported by the run script.
```
options:
   -h|-help     Print this usage information and exit
   -c|-ceed     Ceed backend to be used for the run (optional, default: /cpu/self)
   -e|-example  Example name (optional, default: bp1)
   -n|-np       Specify number of MPI ranks for the run (optional, default: 4)
   -b|-box      Specify the box geometry to be found in ./boxes/ directory (Mandatory)
```
More information on running the Nek5000 examples can be found in the libCEED
[documentation][nek-readme].

Alternatively, one can export the Spack install to a local directory:

```sh
# In the directory that contains the cloned "libCEED" directory
spack view --verbose symlink ceed/libceed libceed
spack view --verbose symlink ceed/petsc petsc
spack view --verbose symlink ceed/mfem mfem
spack view --verbose symlink ceed/nek5000 nek5000
```
and use that to specify the `CEED_DIR`, `MFEM_DIR` and `PETSC_DIR` variables:
```sh
cd libCEED/examples/ceed
make CEED_DIR=../../../ceed/libceed
./ex1-volume -ceed /cpu/self
cd ../mfem
make CEED_DIR=../../../ceed/libceed MFEM_DIR=../../../ceed/mfem
./bp1 -no-vis -o 2 -ceed /cpu/self -m ../../../ceed/mfem/share/mfem/data/star.mesh
./bp3 -no-vis -o 2 -ceed /cpu/self -m ../../../ceed/mfem/share/mfem/data/star.mesh
cd ../petsc
make CEED_DIR=../../../ceed/mfem PETSC_DIR=../../../ceed/petsc
./bps -problem bp1 -degree 2 -ceed /cpu/self
```

### Using Containers
[Docker](https://docker.com) is a popular container system available on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
After installing Docker, running one command
```sh
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/ceed jedbrown/ceed bash
```
gives you a development environment with CEED installed via Spack and the host's current working directory mounted at `/ceed` (the current working directory in the container).
For example,
```sh
host$ git clone https://github.com/ceed/libceed
host$ cd libceed/examples/petsc
host$ docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/ceed jedbrown/ceed bash
container$ make PETSC_DIR=`spack location -i petsc` CEED_DIR=`spack location -i libceed`
container$ mpiexec -n 2 ./bp1
Global dofs: 2541
Process decomposition: 2 1 1
Local elements: 1000 = 10 10 10
Owned dofs: 1210 = 10 11 11
KSP cg CONVERGED_RTOL iterations 34 rnorm 3.992091e-09
Pointwise error (max) 1.267540e-02
```
See the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jedbrown/jedbrown-dockerfiles/blob/master/ceed/Dockerfile) to understand how this image was prepared and/or create your own images.

#### NERSC's Shifter

Containers also work at NERSC using [Shifter](https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/shifter/how-to-use/), a container system designed for HPC.
To pull the latest CEED image, use
```sh
shifterimg pull docker:jedbrown/ceed:3.0
```
then build code using `shifter` commands in place of the `docker` commands above, e.g.,
```sh
host$ shifter --image=docker:jedbrown/ceed:3.0 bash
container$ make PETSC_DIR=`spack location -i petsc` CEED_DIR=`spack location -i libceed`
```
where we see that `shifter` defaults behave similarly to the options we had to give manually for `docker`.
Batch jobs can be submitted via
```sh
sbatch --image docker:jedbrown/ceed:latest ...
```
with the following in your submission script:
```sh
srun -n 64 shifter ./your-petsc-app
```

#### Singularity
[Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/) is another HPC container system with usage similar to Shifter above.
```sh
host$ git clone https://github.com/ceed/libceed
host$ cd libceed
host$ singularity shell docker://jedbrown/ceed:latest
Singularity> make PETSC_DIR=`spack location -i petsc` CEED_DIR=`spack location -i libceed` build/petsc-bps
```
One can run local jobs in the container:
```sh
Singularity> mpiexec -n 4 build/petsc-bps -problem bp3 -benchmark
```
or submit batch jobs from the host with the likes of:
```sh
srun -n 64 singularity exec docker://jedbrown/ceed:latest build/petsc-bps -problem bp3 -benchmark
```
(see instructions for your batch system).

### GPU demo

Below is the full set of commands to install the CEED distribution on a
GPU-capable machine and then use its libCEED GPU kernels to accelerate MFEM,
PETSc and Nek examples. Note that these are very different codes (C++, C, F77)
which can nevertheless take advantage through libCEED of a common set of GPU
kernels.

The `setenv` commands below assume `csh`/`tcsh`. We strongly recommend to add a
`packages.yaml` file in order to avoid long compile times, see [Tips and
Troubleshooting](#tips-and-troubleshooting).

```sh
# Install CEED 3.0 distribution via Spack
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
cd spack
spack install ceed+cuda ^magma cuda_arch=70 ^mfem cuda_arch=sm_70

# Setup CEED component directories
setenv CEED_DIR  `spack location -i libceed`
setenv MFEM_DIR  `spack location -i mfem`
setenv PETSC_DIR `spack location -i petsc`
setenv NEK5K_DIR `spack location -i nek5000`

# Clean OCCA cache
# rm -rf ~/.occa

# Clone libCEED examples directory as proxy for libCEED-based codes
git clone https://github.com/CEED/libCEED.git
mv libCEED/examples ceed-examples
rm -rf libCEED

# libCEED examples on CPU and GPU
cd ceed-examples/ceed
make
./ex1-volume -ceed /cpu/self/ref/blocked
./ex1-volume -ceed /gpu/cuda/gen
cd ../..

# MFEM+libCEED examples on CPU and GPU
cd ceed-examples/mfem
make OPT= CEED_LIBS=
./bp1 -ceed /cpu/self/ref/blocked -no-vis -m $MFEM_DIR/share/mfem/data/star.mesh
./bp1 -ceed /gpu/cuda/gen -no-vis -m $MFEM_DIR/share/mfem/data/star.mesh
cd ../..

# PETSc+libCEED examples on CPU and GPU
cd ceed-examples/petsc
make
./bps -problem bp1 -ceed /cpu/self/ref/blocked
./bps -problem bp1 -ceed /gpu/cuda/gen
cd ../..

# Nek+libCEED examples on CPU and GPU
cd ceed-examples/nek5000
./make-nek-examples.sh
./run-nek-example.sh -ceed /cpu/self/ref/blocked -b 3
./run-nek-example.sh -ceed /gpu/cuda/gen -b 3
cd ../..
```

## Spack for Beginners

Spack is a package manager for scientific software that supports multiple
versions, configurations, platforms, and compilers.

While Spack does not change the build system that already exists in each CEED
component, it coordinates the dependencies between these components and enables
them to be built with the same compilers and options.

If you are new to Spack, here are some Spack commands and options that you may
find useful:

- Spack is a set of Python scripts so there is nothing to install!
  Just download with `git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git` and add
  `spack/bin` to your path with the following commands:
  `. share/spack/setup-env.sh` for `bash`/`zsh` or
  ```
  setenv SPACK_ROOT `pwd`; source $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.csh
  ```
  for `csh`/`tcsh`.

- Spack should automatically locate the standard compilers on your system.  Use
  `spack compilers` to list the ones that have been found. If you need to
  configure additional compilers, you can do that through the config file,
  `~/.spack/compilers.yaml`, or the platform-specific config file,
  `~/.spack/<platform>/compilers.yaml`. Some examples of such files are
  provided below. Check the [Spack documentation][spack-docs] for additional
  details.

- Spack likes to build all of its packages. The file `~/.spack/packages.yaml`,
  and similarly the platform-specific, `~/.spack/<platform>/packages.yaml`,
  allow you to list the packages already installed on your system for Spack to
  use instead of compiling them itself. Some examples are provided below.

- Skip the `-v` option of `spack install` to see only a summary for the building
  of each package (as opposed to the compilation of individual files): `spack
  install ceed`.  You can still turn the detailed build output on and off by
  pressing the `v` key in the Spack terminal.

- To troubleshoot the spack install process: `spack --debug --verbose install ceed`.

- To do a dry run of the spack install process: `spack install --fake ceed`.
  Note that you will have to run `spack uninstall --all` to clean up after this.

- To see the specific packages that will be installed for a particular package,
  e.g. `ceed`, use: `spack spec -I ceed`.

- To see the list of all installed packages: `spack find`.

- To list the location where all different versions of the `ceed` package were
  installed: `spack find --long --paths ceed`. Alternatively, for a specific
  version you can use `spack location --install-dir ceed`.

- To uninstall a package, e.g. mfem, including all packages that depend on it:
  `spack uninstall --all --dependents mfem`, or `spack uninstall /qzn2u7t` for a
  particular hash.

- To uninstall *all* packages that were ever installed by Spack: `spack
  uninstall --all`.  In this case you may also want to clear the caches that
  Spack maintains with: `spack clean -a`.


## Tips and Troubleshooting

### Building on a Mac

The file [ceed3-darwin-highsierra-x86_64-packages.yaml](spack/ceed3-darwin-highsierra-x86_64-packages.yaml)
provides a sample `packages.yaml` file based on [Homebrew][homebrew], that should work on
most Macs. (You can use MacPorts instead of Homebrew if you prefer.)

```yaml
packages:
    all:
        compiler: [clang]
        providers:
            blas: [veclibfort]
            lapack: [veclibfort]
            mpi: [openmpi]
    openmpi:
        paths:
            openmpi@3.0.0: ~/brew
        buildable: False

    cmake:
        paths:
            cmake@3.10.2: ~/brew
        buildable: False
    cuda:
        paths:
            cuda@9.1.85: /usr/local/cuda
        buildable: False
    libx11:
        paths:
            libx11@system: /opt/X11
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    libxt:
        paths:
            libxt@system: /opt/X11
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    xproto:
        paths:
            # see /opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/xproto.pc
            xproto@7.0.31: /opt/X11
        version: [7.0.31]
        buildable: False
    python:
        paths:
            python@2.7.10: /usr
        buildable: False
    zlib:
        paths:
            zlib@1.2.11: /usr
        buildable: False
```

The packages in `~/brew` were installed with `brew install package`.  If you
don't have Homebrew, you can install it and the needed tools with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.git
cd brew
bin/brew install openmpi cmake python zlib
```

The packages in `/usr` are provided by Apple and come pre-built with Mac OS
X. The `cuda` package is provided by NVIDIA and should be installed separately
by downloading it from [NVIDIA][nvidia-dev]. We are using the Clang compiler,
OpenMPI, and Apple's BLAS/LAPACK accelerator library.

### Building on a Linux Desktop

The file [ceed3-linux-rhel7-x86_64-packages.yaml](spack/ceed3-linux-rhel7-x86_64-packages.yaml)
provides a sample `packages.yaml` file that can be adapted to work on a RHEL7 Linux
desktop

```yaml
packages:
    all:
        compiler: [gcc]
        providers:
            mpi: [openmpi]
            blas: [netlib-lapack]
            lapack: [netlib-lapack]
    netlib-lapack:
        paths:
            netlib-lapack@system: /usr/lib64
        buildable: False
    openmpi:
        paths:
            openmpi@3.0.0: ~/local
        buildable: False

    cmake:
        paths:
            cmake@3.10.2: ~/local
        buildable: False
    cuda:
        paths:
            cuda@9.1.85: ~/local/cuda
        buildable: False
    libx11:
        paths:
            libx11@system: /usr
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    libxt:
        paths:
            libxt@system: /usr
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    xproto:
        paths:
            xproto@7.0.32: /usr
        version: [7.0.32]
        buildable: False
    python:
        paths:
             python@2.7.14: /usr
        buildable: False
    zlib:
        paths:
            zlib@1.2.11: /usr/lib64
        buildable: False
```

The above file uses user-installed OpenMPI, CMake and CUDA packages, with the
rest of the CEED prerequisites installed via the [yum package manager][yum].

A very similar file, [ceed3-ubuntu19.10-packages.yaml](spack/ceed3-ubuntu19.10-packages.yaml)
provides Spack configuration for the Ubuntu distribution:

```yaml

            cmake@3.13.4: /usr
        buildable: False
    libx11:
        paths:
            libx11@system: /usr
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    libxt:
        paths:
            libxt@system: /usr
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    xproto:
        paths: # See /usr/share/pkgconfig/xproto.pc for version
            xproto@7.0.32: /usr
        buildable: False
    python:
        paths:
             python@3.7.5: /usr
        buildable: False
    zlib:
        paths:
            zlib@1.2.11: /usr/lib
        buildable: False
```

In this case we use GCC and other development packages via `apt install` and
with MPICH installed separately (as needed to use containerized HPC environments
like Shifter and Singularity). You can use

```sh
docker pull jedbrown/ceed-base
```

to get a build environment with this `packages.yaml` and prerequisites for `spack install ceed`.

### Building at LLNL's Computing Center

#### Lassen

The file [ceed3-lassen-packages.yaml](spack/ceed3-lassen-packages.yaml) is an
example of a `packages.yaml` file for the Lassen system at LLNL's [Livermore
Computing][llnl-lc] center, which is similar to the [Sierra](https://hpc.llnl.gov/hardware/platforms/sierra) supercomputer.

```yaml

        variants: threads=none
        version: [6.1.0]
        buildable: False
    veclibfort:

            spectrum-mpi@2019-01-30%gcc@7.3.1: /usr/tce/packages/spectrum-mpi/spectrum-mpi-2019.01.30-gcc-7.3.1
        buildable: False

    cmake:
        paths:
            cmake@3.14.5: /usr/tce/packages/cmake/cmake-3.14.5
        version: [3.14.5]
        buildable: False
    cuda:
        paths:
            cuda@10.1.243: /usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-10.1.243
        version: [10.1.243]
        buildable: False
    libx11:
        paths:
            libx11@system: /usr
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    libxt:
        paths:
            libxt@system: /usr
        version: [system]
        buildable: False
    xproto:
        paths:
            # see /usr/share/pkgconfig/xproto.pc
            xproto@7.0.31: /usr
        version: [7.0.31]
        buildable: False
    python:
        paths:
            python@2.7.14: /usr/tce/packages/python/python-2.7.14
        version: [2.7.14]
        buildable: False
```
The above file can be used to build CEED with different compilers (xl being
the default), for example:

```sh
spack install ceed%gcc~petsc
```

A corresponding `compilers.yaml` file for Lassen can be found here:
[ceed3-lassen-compilers.yaml](spack/ceed3-lassen-compilers.yaml).

### Building at OLCF

#### Summit

The file [ceed3-summit-packages.yaml](spack/ceed3-summit-packages.yaml) is an example of a
`packages.yaml` file for the Summit system at [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov).

The packages.yaml file gives updated locations for spectrum-mpi and other packeges. Then one has to make sure other modules like xalt are not loaded because xalt provides a conflicting version of "ld" which breaks the build. One may have to load a gcc compiler, e.g., version 6.4.0, and configure it in spack as a compiler.  Then one can compile ceed and dependencies using netlib-lapack as the blas and lapack provider. Here are the commands to do the full compile:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack
source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
cp packages.yaml spack/etc/spack/
module purge
module load gcc/6.4.0 spectrum-mpi/10.3.1.2-20200121 cmake netlib-lapack netlib-scalapack
spack compiler find
./bin/spack install ceed%gcc@6.4.0
```

### Installing CUDA
- Several CEED packages can use CUDA: OCCA, MAGMA, libCEED, PETSc, and MFEM.

- To build these, add the `cuda` variant to the Spack build while specifying the
  desired CUDA architecture for MAGMA and MFEM:
```sh
spack install ceed+cuda ^magma cuda_arch=70 ^mfem cuda_arch=sm_70
```

- You will need to have the NVIDIA CUDA SDK and driver installed on your system,
  see [developer.nvidia.com][nvidia-dev], and specify it in the `packages.yaml`
  file. See, for example, the `cuda` section in [Building on a Mac](#building-on-a-mac),
  or the [ceed3-linux-rhel7-x86_64-packages.yaml](spack/ceed3-linux-rhel7-x86_64-packages.yaml) file.
