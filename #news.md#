test). Nekbench will run the given test in the given parameter space using a
Nek5000 case file which is also given by the user (in the ping-pong tests, the
case file is optional).

Nekbench is written using bash scripting language and runs any Unix-like
operating system that supports bash. It has been successfully tested on Linux
laptops/desktops, ALCF Theta, NERSC Cori (KNL and Haswell), and NERSC Edison
machines for scaling tests.

Planned extensions for Nekbench include adding more machine types like ANL's
Cetus, additional support for the ping-pong test type, and automated plot
generation (e.g., scaling study graphs) for each test run.

### CEED BPs and benchmarks repository released

CEED released an initial set of *bake-off (BP) problems*, which are simple
kernels designed to test and compare the performance of high-order codes, both
internally in CEED, as well as in the [broader high-order
community](https://github.com/kronbichler/ceed_benchmarks_dealii).

In addition to the benchmark descriptions on the [CEED BPs page](bps.md), a
[benchmarks repository](https://github.com/CEED/benchmarks) is publicly
available with several implementations of the CEED bake-off problems.
Currently, MFEM, Nek5000 and deal.ii are included, see directories
[tests/mfem_bps](https://github.com/CEED/benchmarks/tree/master/tests/mfem_bps),
[tests/nek5000_bps](https://github.com/CEED/benchmarks/tree/master/tests/nek5000_bps)
and
[tests/dealii_bps](https://github.com/CEED/benchmarks/tree/master/tests/dealii_bps)
respectively.

### New Laghos and NekCEM CEEDling miniapps released

Two new miniapps developed in CEED were released in June 2017: Laghos and NekCEM
CEEDling.

Laghos (LAGrangian High-Order Solver) is a new miniapp developed in CEED that
solves the time-dependent Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics in a
moving Lagrangian frame using unstructured high-order finite element spatial
discretization and explicit high-order time-stepping. In CEED, Laghos serves as
a proxy for a sub-component of the MARBL/LLNLApp application.

NekCEM CEEDling is a new NekCEM miniapp, solving the time-domain Maxwell
equation for electromagnetic systems.

For more details, see the CEED [miniapps page](miniapps.md) and the
[Laghos](https://github.com/ceed/Laghos) and [NekCEM
CEEDling](https://github.com/NekCEM/NekCEM_CEEDling) repositories on GitHub.

### Paper with MPICH at SC17

Joint paper with the MPICH group, *Why is MPI so Slow? Analyzing the fundamental limits in implementing MPI-3.1* [accepted in Supercomputing 2017](http://sc17.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=pap554&sess=sess163).
The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the software overheads in the MPI
performance-critical path and exposes mandatory performance overheads that are
unavoidable based on the MPI-3.1 specification.

### STRUMPACK support in MFEM

Support for the sparse direct solver and preconditioner STRUMPACK [has been
integrated](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/pull/222) in MFEM.

[STRUMPACK](http://poratal.nersc.gov/project/sparse/strumpack) is being
developed at LBNL and is part of the ECP project *Factorization Based Sparse
Solvers and Preconditioners* (Xiaoye Sherry Li and Pieter Ghysels). The
STRUMPACK solver is based on multifrontal sparse Gaussian elimination and uses
hierarchically semi-separable matrices to compress fill-in. It can be used as an
exact direct solver or as an algebraic, robust and parallel preconditioner for a
range of discretized PDE problems.

### 2017 PETSc User Meeting

Over 75 participants from all over the world attended the PETSc User Meeting,
held June 14-16 in Boulder, CO. Hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder, the
event consisted of a one-day tutorial on the solver library PETSc and showcased
the latest research enabled by the functionality available in PETSc. The
[meeting agenda](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/meetings/2017/index.html) covered
a total of 15 talks, four posters, and two panels.

Thanks to generous support from Intel and Tech-X, 22 students received travel
grants and got to learn about the latest techniques on the large-scale numerical
solution of partial differential equations.

PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel)
solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential
equations. It has become one of the most widely used numerical software packages
of its kind and has users in application areas ranging from acoustics and
arterial flow to seismology and semiconductors.

### Workshop on Batched, Reproducible, and Reduced Precision BLAS

The second [Workshop on Batched, Reproducible, and Reduced Precision BLAS](http://bit.ly/Batch-BLAS-2017)
was held in Atlanta, GA on February 23-25, 2017 including many members of the CEED [MAGMA](magma.md) team.

The goal of this workshop was to touch on extending the Basic Linear Algebra
Software Library (BLAS).  The existing BLAS have proven to be very effective in
assisting portable, efficient software for sequential and some of the current
class of high-performance computers. New computational needs in many
applications have motivated the need to investigate the possibility of extending
the currently accepted standards to provide greater parallelism for small size
operations, reproducibility, and reduced precision support.

Of particular interest to CEED is the use of batched BLAS for finite element
tensor contractions, and thus our team is interested in the establishment of a
batched BLAS standard, highly-optimized implementations, and support from
vendors on various architectures.

This is the second workshop of an open forum to discuss and formalize details
related to batched, reproducible, and reduced precision BLAS. The agenda and the
talks from the first workshop can be found [here](http://bit.ly/Batch-BLAS-2016).
