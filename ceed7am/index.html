In term, the mechanical response can also vary quite a bit from traditional techniques and also from other AM builds due to varying processing conditions. The ExaAM project is developing a number of high-fidelity simulation capabilities and workflows that goes from the melt pool physics all the way up to part scale response. The aim of the ExaAM project is to provide predictive simulation results that can guide the AM design process and help accelerate part qualifications. Within this study, we will examine the workflows necessary to connect process-aware built microstructures to macroscopic yield surfaces used in part scale simulations using ExaConstit. Results from this study will be examined using simulations of the NIST IN625 AMB2018-01 part build and will utilize the new exascale computer, Frontier, located at ORNL.</em></td>

The simulations treat as much physics from essential principles as is practical, including laser deposition, cross beam energy transfer, x-ray production and transport, NLTE kinetics, thermal transport, hydrodynamic instabilities, thermonuclear burn, and transport of reaction products. These simulations were used to optimize the target designs, making use of increased laser energy, to give them greater robustness. Preshot predictions of the first experiment that surpassed breakeven yielded thermonuclear burn conditions matched the experimental results reasonably well, with a target gain of ~1.5. We will cover the key developments in radiation hydrodynamic codes and modeling methodologies that enabled these simulations.</em></td>

<td><strong>FUSE - A Face Upwinded Spectral Element Method for Conversation Laws</strong> <br> Per-Olof Persson (UC Berkley) <br> <em>We present a new high-order accurate discretization on unstructured meshes of quadrilateral meshes. Our Face Upwinded Spectral Element (FUSE) method uses the same node distribution as a high-order continuous Galerkin (CG) method, but with a particular choice of high-order node locations within each element and an upwinded stencil on the face nodes. This results in a number of benefits, including fewer degrees of freedom, straight-forward integration with CG, and a highly sparse line-based connectivity pattern. We present the derivation of the scheme and the analysis of its properties, in particular stability and conservation for arbitrary polynomial degrees. We show numerous numerical evidence for its accuracy, efficiency, and high sparsity compared to traditional schemes, on multiple classes of problems including convection-dominated flows, the Euler equations, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</em></td>

STRUMPACK also provides several preconditioners, based on sparse multifrontal factorization with rank-structured approximations of the frontal matrices, the dense sub-blocks in the sparse triangular factors.

<td><strong>Matrix-free preconditioners for high-order H(div) discretizations</strong> <br> Will Pazner (Portland State) <br> <em>Many problems of physical relevance are posed in the Sobolev space H(div), including porous media flow, radiation diffusion, and magnetohydrodynamics. The iterative solution of the large linear systems that result from high-order finite element discretizations of problems in H(div) remains challenging. In this talk, I will describe the construction of "matrix-free" solvers for high-order grad-div and Darcy problems in H(div). These solvers are designed to work on meshes of high-order tensor-product elements (quadrilaterals and hexahedra), and make use of properties of one-dimensional interpolation and histopolation operators. We will show that the condition number of the preconditioned system is bounded independent of polynomial degree and mesh size, and so the number of iterations is asymptotically O(1), resulting in a solver with quasi-optimal computational complexity. High-performance and GPU-accelerated implementations will be discussed.</em></td>

<td><strong>Multiplicative Smoothers for Multi-Level Solvers: the quadratic eigenvalue problem for ORAS</strong> <br> Stephen Thomas (AMD) <br> <em>We have re-formulated the Gram-Schmidt and GMRES algorithms -- thereby greatly enhancing the strong scaling properties - and we extended and proved new backward error results - by introducing the IGS-GMRES variant and now MGS-CGS GMRES. Based on these ideas we have introduced composite smoothers (L1-Jacobi +Gauss-Seidel) for algebraic multigrid and optimized Schwarz - which lead to 3x faster solve times on GPU architectures . The Gershgorin circle theorem shows how these improve with the problem size. With Erika Strakova in Ostrava - we are finally making progress on optimized RAS by extending the work of St-Cyr, Gander and Thomas (2007) to irregular domains, and this channels Barry Smith et al. (1996), by applying variational techniques to the FEM boundary conditions in integral form and solves the quadratic eigenvalue problem for the optimal transmission conditions. Numerical experiments confirm the decrease in the number of GMRES iterations.</em></td>

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were evolved using the high-order, spectral element code, NekRS, on Summit and Polaris. Time advancement was carried out via third-order BDF/extrapolation, with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and independent system solves for the viscous and pressure updates. The DNS mean velocity profiles, velocity correlations, and the locations of the separation/reattachment points, compare well with the available data. This talk will also present details of the scaling and performance of NekRS for the cases considered, the preconditioning strategies, and the inflow turbulence generation for the Boeing Speed Bump case which is not periodic in the streamwise direction.</em></td>

<td><strong>Performant Low-order Matrix-free Finite Element Kernels on GPU Architectures</strong> <br> Yohann Dudouit (LLNL) <br> <em>Numerical methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) have been successfully adapted to utilize the computational power of GPU accelerators. However, much of the effort around applying FEM to GPUs has been focused on high-order FEM due to higher arithmetic intensity and order of accuracy. For applications such as the simulation of geologic reservoirs, high levels of heterogeneity results in high resolution grids characterized by highly discontinuous (cell-wise) material property fields, and low-order methods are typically employed. In this study, we present a strategy for implementing highly performant low-order matrix-free FEM operator kernels in the context of the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Performance results of matrix-free Laplace and isotropic elasticity operator kernels are presented and are shown to compare favorably to matrix-based SpMV operators on V100, A100, and MI250X GPUs.</em></td>

Advances in large-scale solvers have fueled a new class of discretizations that make different assumptions than prior data models. This makes accurate visualization a difficult exercise, requiring significantly more memory to faithfully represent new discretizations in the original data model. Recently, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and the Army Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) have funded efforts to modernize the data model in VTK and, by extension, ParaView.
