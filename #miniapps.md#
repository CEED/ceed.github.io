## CEED Miniapps

CEED is developing a variety of miniapps encapsulating key physics and numerical
kernels of high-order applications.  The miniapps are designed to be used in a
variety of [co-design](codesign.md) activities with ECP vendors, software
technologies projects as well as external partners.

CEED's current miniapps are documented below and can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ceed). Please contact the CEED team if you have any
questions.

### Nekbone
</center>

Nekbone solves a standard Poisson equation using a conjugate gradient iteration
with a simple or spectral element multigrid preconditioner on a block or linear
geometry.

It exposes the principal computational kernel to reveal the essential elements
of the algorithmic-architectural coupling that is pertinent to [Nek5000](nek.md),
relevant to large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulation (DNS) of
turbulence in complex domains.

Nekbone-3.1 was released in Oct 2013 as part of the [CESAR co-design
center](http://cesar.mcs.anl.gov/content/software/thermal_hydraulics).

### Laghos <span class="badge">New</span>
</center>

Laghos solves the time-dependent Euler equation of compressible gas dynamics in
a moving Lagrangian frame using high-order finite element spatial discretization
and explicit high-order time-stepping.

It exposes the principal computational kernels of shock-capturing compressible
flow, including the FLOP-intensive definition of artificial viscosity at
quadrature points.

*Laghos will be released soon as part of CEED. Stay tuned for more details...*

### HPGMG-FE
</center>

The High-Performance Geometric Multigrid Finite Element benchmark is a
Full Multigrid solver for a third order accurate finite element
discretization of an elliptic operator on mapped grids.  The benchmark
is designed to give a picture of the "performance spectrum" across a
range of problem sizes and thus solution time, thereby giving a clear
picture of both weak and strong scaling concerns.  For more information,
source code, and machine comparisons, see the
[HPGMG website](https://hpgmg.org).

### MFEM Example Codes
</center>

The [MFEM](mfem.md) distribution includes a large number of simple example codes
that can be viewed as simple miniapps for model high-order physics:

 - [Example 1](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex1_8cpp_source.html): nodal H1 FEM for the Laplace problem,
 - [Example 2](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex2_8cpp_source.html): vector FEM for linear elasticity,
 - [Example 3](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex3_8cpp_source.html): Nedelec H(curl) FEM for the definite Maxwell problem,
 - [Example 4](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex4_8cpp_source.html): Raviart-Thomas H(div) FEM for the grad-div problem,
 - [Example 5](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex5_8cpp_source.html): mixed pressure-velocity FEM for the Darcy problem,
 - [Example 6](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex6_8cpp_source.html): non-conforming adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for the Laplace problem,
 - [Example 7](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex7_8cpp_source.html): Laplace problem on a surface (the unit sphere),
 - [Example 8](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex8_8cpp_source.html): Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) for the Laplace problem,
 - [Example 9](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex9_8cpp_source.html): Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) time-dependent advection,
 - [Example 10](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex10_8cpp_source.html): time-dependent implicit nonlinear elasticity,
 - [Example 11](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex11p_8cpp_source.html): parallel Laplace eigensolver,
 - [Example 12](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex12p_8cpp_source.html): parallel linear elasticity eigensolver,
 - [Example 13](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex13p_8cpp_source.html): parallel Maxwell eigensolver,
 - [Example 14](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex14_8cpp_source.html): Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) for the Laplace problem,
 - [Example 15](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex15_8cpp_source.html): parallel dynamic AMR for Laplace with prescribed time-dependent source,
 - [Example 16](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex16_8cpp_source.html): parallel time-dependent nonlinear heat equation,
 - [Example 17](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/ex17_8cpp_source.html): parallel Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) for linear elasticity.

Most of the examples have a serial and a parallel version, illustrating the ease
of transition and the minimal code changes between the two.

Of particular relevance to CEED is the HPC versions of the example codes that
use a [set of templated classes](http://mfem.org/performance/) to efficiently
implement high-order operator evaluation.
