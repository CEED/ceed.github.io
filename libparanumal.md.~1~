OCCA is an open-source library that facilitates programming in an environment
containing different types of devices. It abstracts devices and lets the user
pick at run-time, for example: CPUs, GPUs, Intelâ€™s Xeon Phi, FPGAs.

OCCA abstracts the variety of device programming languages into one kernel
language, the OCCA kernel language (OKL). OKL minimally extends C and restricts
the user to write parallel code that is JIT compiled.

OCCA is freely available under an MIT license.

In CEED, OCCA is primarily involved in the efforts of the [Software](sw.md) and
[Finite Element](fe.md) thrusts.
